What is Linux?

Linux is a free, open source operating system that enables the communication between computer hardware and software. The Linux OS was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

Why use Linux?

Open source

Community Support

Support wide variety of hardware

Most servers runs on Linux

Secure compared to Windows

Linux distributions

There are many Linux distributions available in the market. It provides a different flavor of the Linux operating system to the users. Popular distros are :

Ubuntu

Fedora

Debian

Linux Mint  and so on.

Linux File System

Linux provides a dedicated set of file systems that stores every bit of data required for booting up the Linux systems. The file system holds the collection of data or files stored within the computer's hard disk or storage device.

Use "man heir" to find more insights on linux files system


ls /etc/ 

This directory contains all the configuration files of your application. if something goes wrong you should be looking in this directory.


ls /bin

This directory contains binaries for use by all users and also contains executable files, Linux commands that are used in single user mode, and common commands that are used by all the users, like cat, cp, cd, ls, etc

ls /sbin

This directory contains binaries to configure the operating system and executable files. It only contains system binaries which require root privilege to perform certain tasks and are helpful for system maintenance purposes. e.g. fsck, root, init, ifconfig, etc

ls /lib

This directory contains shared libraries which are often used by the ‚Äò/bin‚Äô and ‚Äò/sbin‚Äô directories. It also contains a kernel module. These filenames are identable as ld* or lib*.so.*

ls /opt

This directory's main purpose is to store optional application software packages. In many cases this is software from outside the distribution repository. Add-on applications from individual vendors should be installed in ‚Äò/opt‚Äô. In some systems ‚Äò/opt‚Äô is empty as they may not have any add-on application.

ls /tmp

This directory in Linux based systems contains necessary files that are temporarily required by the system as well as other software and applications running on the machine.

For example, when you are writing a document, all the content inside that document is saved as a temporary file inside the /tmp directory. After you have saved it, it gets stored in your preferred location, and the temporary file gets removed once you exit the document.

ls /boot

This directory contains the linux boot configuration files. This is one of the MOST important folders. Removing anything from this directory or a file getting corrupted will result in an OS crash after reboot. Your system won't be able to boot without files in the /boot directory.


ls /dev

This directory contains files that represent devices that are attached to the local system. However, these are not regular files that a user can read and write to; these files are called device files or special files. Device files are abstractions of standard devices that applications interact with via I/O system calls.

ls /media

The /media directory contains subdirectories where removable media devices inserted into the computer are mounted. For example, when you insert a CD into your Linux system, a directory will automatically be created inside the /media directory. You can access the contents of the CD inside this directory.

ls /mnt

This directory and its subdirectories are intended for use as the temporary mount points for mounting storage devices, such as CDROMs, floppy disks and USB (universal serial bus) key drives. /mnt is a standard subdirectory of the root directory on Linux


ls /proc
This directory is for each process running on our system. It also contains some configuration files
ls /var
This directory contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files.
There are 7 types of files in Linux
Normal files
Directories
References to files
Character device files
Block device files
Symbolic links
Local domain sockets/named pipes

Installing a Linux Virtual Machine					
There are a variety of ways to install a Linux System.
For example,if you are currently running Windows as your primary operating system, then you may be able to dual boot Linux alongside Windows, but this method is not beginner-friendly. 
What is a Virtual Machine?					
A virtual machine is simply a computer running from within another computer (host). A virtual machine shares the host resources and behaves exactly like a standalone physical machine. 					
The process of installing a virtual machine is straightforward; you only need to follow the following steps:	
1.InstallVirtualBox(orVMwarePlayer).					
2. Download an ISO image of any Linux distribution.
3. Open up VirtualBox and begin the installation process. 
Download VirtualBox at the following link: www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 		
Download Ubuntu LTS at the following link: www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop 




















Setup for Ubuntu
First, open VirtualBox, then click "New" to create a virtual machine.



NOTE: Select any amount of memory you wish, but don't add more than 50 percent of your total RAM.
Check the "Create a virtual hard disk now" option so we can later define our Ubuntu OS virtual hard disk size. Now, we want to select "VHD (Virtual Hard Disk)".




Next, we'll dynamically allocate storage on our physical hard disk



We want to specify our Ubuntu OS's size. The recommended size is 10 GB, but you can increase the size if you wish.






After creating a virtual hard disk, you'll see Ubuntu in your dashboard.

Now, we have to set up the Ubuntu disk image file (.iso).The Ubuntu disk image file can be downloaded here: Ubuntu OS download

To set up the Ubuntu disk image file, go to settings and follow these steps:
Click "Storage"
In storage devices, click "Empty"
In attributes, click the disk image and "Choose Virtual Optical Disk File"
Select the Ubuntu disk image file and open it

Click OK.
Your Ubuntu OS is ready to install in VirtualBox. Let's start!

NOTE: Ubuntu VirtualBox installation and actual OS installation steps may vary. This guide helps you to install Ubuntu in VirtualBox only.
Let's install Ubuntu!
Click Install Ubuntu.

Select your keyboard layout.

In the "Updates and other software" section, check "Normal installation" and continue.

In "Installation type", check "Erase disk and install Ubuntu".

Click "Continue".

Choose your current location.

Now, set up your profile.

You'll see Ubuntu installed.

After the installation, restart it.

After logging in, you'll see the Ubuntu desktop.











Successfully installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox. It's ready to use for your future development projects.
Verify the installation.Open your terminal (Press Ctrl+Alt+T) and type in the commands below and check if they work-  pwd: This will print the current working directory,
